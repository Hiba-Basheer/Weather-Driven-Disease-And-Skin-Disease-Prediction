Published: 2 December 2001

Key Facts:
- Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are extremely common in children under 5 worldwide.  
- Majority of ARIs in this age group are upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, cough).  
- Drug therapy for viral colds shows **limited or negligible benefits** in most cases.

Scope:
- Focus is on children under 5 with acute respiratory infections.  
- Reviews randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on efficacy & safety of treatments for cough and cold.  

Findings:
- Many cough/cold remedies do **not significantly shorten the duration** of cold symptoms in young children.  
- Warning against unnecessary antibiotic use for common colds, since antibiotics do not help viral infections or prevent complications such as pneumonia.  
- Emphasis on safety: Some remedies may have side effects; many are not well studied in very young children.

Recommendations:
- Avoid using antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated viral coughs / colds in young children.  
- Focus on supportive care (hydration, rest) rather than over‐the‐counter remedies unless evidence-based and age-appropriate.  
- Health workers / caregivers should be cautious about the products used in children under 5.

Implications:
- Helps in combating misuse of antibiotics and drug overuse.  
- Important for public health messaging: caregivers should know that “over-the-counter cough medicines” are not always helpful and may pose risks for young children.
