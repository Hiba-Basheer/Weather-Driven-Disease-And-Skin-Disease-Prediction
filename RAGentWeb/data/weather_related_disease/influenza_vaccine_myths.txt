Title: 5 Myths about the Flu Vaccine

Source: WHO – Influenza: Are We Ready? “5 Myths about the Flu Vaccine”

Myth 1: Influenza is not serious so I don’t need the vaccine  
Fact: As many as **650,000 people** a year can die of the flu (these are respiratory deaths; likely impact is higher). Even healthy people can get flu; those with vulnerable immune systems are especially at risk. Some people may develop complications — sinus or ear infections, pneumonia, and inflammations of heart or brain.

Myth 2: The flu vaccine can give me the flu  
Fact: The injected flu vaccine contains an inactivated virus that cannot cause influenza. If you feel achy or mildly feverish, that’s usually just your immune response, and it lasts a day or two.

Myth 3: The flu vaccine can cause severe side effects  
Fact: The vaccine is proven safe. Severe side effects are **extremely rare** — about **one in a million** may get Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), which can cause muscle weakness or paralysis.

Myth 4: I had the vaccine and still got the flu, so it doesn’t work  
Fact: Multiple flu virus strains circulate simultaneously; vaccines target specific strains, so mismatches can occur. But vaccination still improves protection, especially for vulnerable populations.

Myth 5: I am pregnant so I shouldn’t get the flu vaccine  
Fact: Pregnant women are especially recommended to get the flu vaccine. Their immune systems are weaker, and they are more vulnerable. The inactivated vaccine is safe at any stage of pregnancy.
