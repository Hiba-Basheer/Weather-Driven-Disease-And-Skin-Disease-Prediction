Title: Dengue and Severe Dengue (WHO Fact Sheet)

Source: WHO Fact Sheet – https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue

Key Facts:
- Dengue is a viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV), transmitted by mosquitoes.
- About half of the world’s population is at risk of dengue, with an estimated 100–400 million infections per year.
- The infection is found in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.
- Severe dengue can be fatal, requiring careful management by medical professionals.

Overview:
- Dengue (also called break‑bone fever) is a viral infection spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
- Most people who get dengue have mild or no symptoms and recover in 1–2 weeks.
- Severe dengue is a rare complication that can cause hospitalization, organ impairment, and even death.
- Symptoms typically start 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days.

Symptoms:
- High fever
- Severe headache
- Pain behind the eyes
- Muscle and joint pains
- Nausea, vomiting
- Swollen glands
- Rash

Warning signs of severe dengue include:
- Severe abdominal pain
- Persistent vomiting
- Rapid breathing
- Bleeding gums or nose
- Fatigue, restlessness
- Blood in vomit or stool

Transmission:
- Dengue is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti.
- The mosquitoes are active during early morning and before sunset.
- Transmission can occur from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic infected persons.

Diagnostics and Treatment:
- Diagnosis is made with laboratory tests such as NAAT, ELISA, and rapid diagnostic tests.
- No specific antiviral treatment exists for dengue.
- Supportive care: pain relief (paracetamol), fluids, rest.
- Avoid NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or aspirin, as they can worsen bleeding.
- Severe dengue cases require hospitalization and close monitoring.

Prevention and Control:
- Prevent mosquito bites using repellents, protective clothing, and mosquito nets.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by covering water containers and improving waste management.
- Community participation in vector control is crucial.
- Environmental management and government-led vector control strategies help reduce transmission.

Risk Factors:
- Previous dengue infection increases the risk of severe dengue.
- Factors such as high temperatures, rainfall, rapid urbanization, poor water storage, and waste management contribute to outbreaks.
