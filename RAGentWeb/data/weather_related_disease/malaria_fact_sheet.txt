Title: Malaria (WHO Fact Sheet)

Source: WHO – https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria

Key Facts:
- In 2023, there were about 263 million malaria cases globally and 597,000 malaria deaths in 83 countries.
- The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of malaria burden: ~94% of cases and ~95% of deaths.
- Approximately 76% of all malaria deaths occur in children under 5 years.

Overview:
- Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that enters humans through mosquito bites.
- Most infections cause mild symptoms (fever, chills, headache), but untreated malaria can lead to severe illness and death.
- There are 5 Plasmodium species that cause malaria in humans; P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most significant.

Symptoms:
- Fever, chills, headache.
- Nausea, vomiting.
- Body aches, malaise.
- Severe symptoms: fatigue, seizures, difficulty breathing, confusion, dark or bloody urine, jaundice, abnormal bleeding.

Disease Burden:
- High incidence in tropical climates, especially sub-Saharan Africa.
- Children under 5 and pregnant women are at higher risk.
- Malaria during pregnancy can cause low birth weight and premature delivery.

Transmission:
- Transmission occurs via bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
- Other transmission: blood transfusion, contaminated needles.
- Incubation usually 10–15 days after the bite.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
- Diagnosis depends on laboratory tests: microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
- Treatment typically uses antimalarial medicines; specifics depend on species and resistance.
- In many areas, artemisinin-based combination therapies are first-line for P. falciparum.
- Drugs such as chloroquine or primaquine may be used depending on species and resistance.

Prevention and Control:
- Use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).
- Wearing protective clothing; use insect repellents; window screens.
- Preventive chemotherapies in vulnerable populations.
- Vaccines: approval of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and rollout in high-transmission zones.

Risk Factors:
- Young children, pregnant women, travelers, immunocompromised individuals.
- Poor mosquito control, resistance to medicines/insecticides.
- Environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, urbanization.
