Key Facts:
- Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for ~17.9 million deaths each year.
- CVDs include a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels — coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, etc.
- More than 80% of CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes; about one-third of those occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

Risk Factors:
- Behavioral risk factors: unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol.
- Environmental risk factors: air pollution.
- Intermediate risk factors measurable in primary care: raised blood pressure (hypertension), high blood glucose, high blood lipids, overweight & obesity.

Symptoms (Heart Attack / Stroke):
- Chest pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest; or pain in arms, left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.
- Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath.
- Nausea, vomiting, light-headedness, cold sweat, turning pale.
- For stroke: sudden weakness of face, arm or leg (often on one side), confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding, difficulty seeing, loss of balance or coordination, severe headache with no known cause, fainting.

Other Conditions:
- Rheumatic heart disease: symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, chest pain, fainting.
- Rheumatic fever (which can lead to heart disease) may show fever, pain and swelling in joints, vomiting, stomach cramps.

Prevention & Management:
- Lifestyle changes: diet (reduced salt intake, more fruits & vegetables), regular physical activity, cessation of tobacco use, reducing harmful alcohol use.
- Environmental policy: improving air quality, reducing pollution.
- Health system: identifying high-risk individuals, ensuring access to medicines and basic health technologies in primary care.
- Treatment: diagnosis and management of intermediate risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol), management of acute events (heart attack, stroke), rehabilitation services.

Importance:
- Early detection of risk factors and behavioral interventions can prevent many premature deaths.
- Global and national health policies are required to make healthy choices affordable and environments conducive to heart-healthy behaviors.
- Access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment & care is essential in reducing burden of CVDs.
