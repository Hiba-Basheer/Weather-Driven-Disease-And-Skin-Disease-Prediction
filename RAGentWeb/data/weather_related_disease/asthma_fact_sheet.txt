Key Facts:
- Asthma is a major noncommunicable disease (NCD), affecting both children and adults; it is the most common chronic disease among children.
- Inflammation and narrowing of the small airways in the lungs cause asthma symptoms: any combination of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.
- In 2019, asthma affected an estimated 262 million people and caused 455,000 deaths globally.
- Asthma can be controlled with medication and by avoiding triggers, allowing people to lead normal, active lives.
- Most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where under-diagnosis and under-treatment are common challenges.

Overview:
- Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes breathing harder.
- Symptoms may vary over time and in intensity. They can come and go, and sometimes worsen (asthma attack).
- Common symptoms: persistent cough (especially at night), wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness.
- Triggers: respiratory infections, allergens (dust, pollen, mould, animals), air pollution, tobacco smoke, strong irritants like perfume or fumes, changes in weather.

Risk Factors / Causes:
- Family history: having close relatives with asthma.
- Other allergic conditions such as eczema (atopic dermatitis) and rhinitis (hay fever).
- Early life events: premature birth, low birth weight, early viral respiratory infections, exposure to tobacco smoke.
- Environmental risk factors: indoor/outdoor air pollution, dust mites, mould, occupational exposure to chemicals.

Treatment & Self-Care:
- Asthma cannot be cured but is treatable. Inhalers (bronchodilators and steroids) are the mainstay of treatment.
- Inhalers help open air passages and reduce inflammation.
- Routine care may require daily inhaler use depending on severity.
- Use spacers to improve effectiveness of inhaled treatment, especially in children.
- Avoiding triggers, maintaining good environment, asthma action plans, monitoring symptoms.

WHO Response & Other Information:
- Asthma included in WHO’s Global Action Plan for prevention and control of NCDs and United Nation’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.
- Improving access to safe and affordable inhalers and medications is a priority.
- Education, awareness, and proper treatment are essential, especially in low-resource settings.
