Eczema / Atopic Dermatitis:  
- Included as one of the common skin diseases in the “common skin diseases” group.

- Visible characteristics are used to help identify eczema in community settings (redness, itchiness, dryness, scaling etc.), though precise diagnostic criteria are beyond this guide.

Importance:

- Health workers can use visual cues in skin to distinguish eczema from fungal infections, scabies, or other dermatoses.
- Education and awareness of skin conditions like eczema help reduce delays in care and prevent complications.
