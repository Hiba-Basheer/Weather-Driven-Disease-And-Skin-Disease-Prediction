Key Facts:
- There are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, including 3–5 million cases of severe illness. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- It causes 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths annually. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- 99% of deaths in children under 5 years of age with influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections are in developing countries. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Symptoms begin 1-4 days after infection and usually last around a week. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Overview:
- Seasonal influenza (the flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. Most people recover without special treatment. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- There are 4 types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, D). Types A and B are what usually cause seasonal epidemics. Influenza A has subtypes (e.g. H1N1, H3N2), which are important in vaccine formulation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Signs and Symptoms:
- Sudden onset of fever  
- Cough (usually dry)  
- Headache  
- Muscle and joint pain  
- Severe malaise (feeling very unwell)  
- Sore throat  
- Runny nose :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

At-risk & Severe Cases:
- Severe cases especially among people who are pregnant, children under 5, older adults (65+), people with chronic medical conditions, people with immunosuppression. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Influenza can worsen symptoms of underlying chronic diseases. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

Diagnosis:
- Usually clinically diagnosed; but lab testing is needed to confirm during low activity or to distinguish from other respiratory infections. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Tests include: antigen detection, virus isolation, detection of influenza RNA by RT-PCR. Rapid diagnostic tests are also used though less sensitive. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

Treatment:
- Most people recover on their own with rest, fluids, and symptom relief. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Antiviral medications for people at high risk or with severe symptoms. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

Prevention:
- Vaccination is primary preventive measure; often updated to match circulating strains. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Hand hygiene; cover mouth when coughing/sneezing; stay home when unwell; protect high-risk groups. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

WHO Response & Surveillance:
- WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors influenza viruses globally; helps decide vaccine compositions. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Includes diagnostics, antiviral susceptibility monitoring, outbreak response, and research into vaccine effectiveness. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
