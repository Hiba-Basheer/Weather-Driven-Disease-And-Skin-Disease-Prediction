Key Facts:
- Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous system.  
- Globally, almost 3 billion people are living with migraine or tension-type headache.  
- Migraine is ranked as the second leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs).  
- Tension-type headache is the most prevalent headache disorder.

Types & Overview:
- Major types include migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, and medication-overuse headache.  
- Migraine involves recurrent attacks, often moderate to severe, frequently throbbing pain, usually unilateral, worsened by physical activity or sensory stimuli.  
- Tension-type headache typically causes bilateral, pressing/tightening pain, mild-to-moderate intensity, not aggravated by physical activity.  
- Medication-overuse headache arises from frequent use of acute headache medication.

Symptoms:
- throbbing or pulsating pain, typically on one side (migraine); or steady, pressing/tightening (tension-type).  
- Nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia) seen in migraine.  
- Headache attacks often last 4–72 hours (for migraine).  
- Frequency varies: tension-type headaches may occur many times per month or even daily.

Impact / Burden:
- Significant disability worldwide; impacts work, school, family life.  
- Often underdiagnosed and undertreated, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  
- Causes economic losses both at individual and societal levels due to absenteeism and decreased productivity.

Risk Factors & Triggers:
- Genetic predisposition (especially for migraine).  
- Environmental triggers: stress, sleep deprivation, irregular meals, dehydration, light, noise.  
- Hormonal changes (in females), certain foods/drinks, weather changes, sensory stimuli.  
- Overuse of headache medications.

Diagnosis & Management:
- Based on history (frequency, features, triggers) and symptom description; diagnostic criteria for migraine and tension-type headache exist (e.g., ICHD classification).  
- Non-pharmacological management: lifestyle modification (sleep, diet, hydration, stress management).  
- Pharmacological treatments:
  - Acute treatments: analgesics, NSAIDs, triptans (for migraine).
  - Preventive/prophylactic treatments for frequent migraines (beta-blockers, certain antidepressants, antiepileptics, etc.).  
- Treatment of medication-overuse headache involves withdrawal of overused medications, counseling, patient education.

Prevention & Education:
- Raise awareness of triggers & early warning symptoms.  
- Promote healthy lifestyle: regular sleep schedule, balanced diet, hydration, stress control.  
- Limit use of acute pain medications; avoid medication overuse.  
- Improve access to healthcare, diagnostic services, and evidence-based treatments.
