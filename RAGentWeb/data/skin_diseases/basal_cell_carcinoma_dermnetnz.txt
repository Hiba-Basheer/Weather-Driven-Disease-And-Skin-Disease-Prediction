What is Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)?
- BCC is the most common form of skin cancer.  
- It originates in the basal cells — small, round skin cells found in the lower part of the epidermis.

Epidemiology & Risk:
- More common in fair-skinned individuals.  
- Incidence increases with age; cumulative sun exposure is a major risk.  
- High risk with repeated sunburns, especially early in life.  
- Other risk factors: UV radiation (sunlight, tanning devices), genetic predisposition, immunosuppression.

Clinical Features:
- Usually a slow-growing tumour.  
- Common forms: nodular (pearls or translucent nodules), superficial, pigmented, ulcerated.  
- Lesions often appear on sun-exposed areas (face, ears, neck, scalp).  
- Can have rolled borders, pearly sheen, telangiectasia (tiny blood vessels visible), slow ulceration ("rodent ulcer") in advanced lesions.

Diagnosis:
- Primarily clinical appearance, sometimes dermatoscopic evaluation.  
- Biopsy required for confirmation if diagnosis is uncertain.

Prognosis & Complications:
- Rarely metastasises (spreads), but can be locally invasive and destructive, especially if neglected.  
- Can lead to tissue loss, disfigurement, especially when on sensitive areas (nose, eyes).

Treatment:
- Surgical excision with recommended safety margins.  
- Other options: Mohs surgery (in certain locations), curettage & electrodessication, topical therapies (for superficial types), cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy.  
- For deeply invasive or problematic cases, radiotherapy may be considered.

Prevention:
- Sun protection (broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing, hats).  
- Avoid tanning beds / artificial UV.  
- Regular skin checks, especially for individuals with high exposure or risk factors.  
- Public awareness of early detection; note changes in skin lesions.

Important Notes:
- Because of its slow growth, BCC is often treatable with good outcomes when detected early.  
- Delay in treatment can result in larger lesions, higher cost/complexity of treatment, more cosmetic damage.
