Key Facts:
- This resource presents images of benign melanocytic naevi (moles) in people with skin of colour (various Fitzpatrick skin types).
- Includes macro (clinical) photos and dermoscopic images showing appearance across different skin tones, lighting, and background contexts.
- Category: Lesions (benign); Diagnosis & Testing.

Importance:
- Visual variability: naevi may look different (colour intensity, border sharpness, size contrast) depending on skin tone.
- Helps clinicians and users to better distinguish naevi from suspicious lesions in skin of colour, reducing misclassification.
- Useful as diagnostic visual aid, especially for distinguishing benign naevi vs atypical pigmented lesions.
