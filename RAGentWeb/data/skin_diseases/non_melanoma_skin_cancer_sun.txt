Title: Working Under the Sun Causes 1 in 3 Deaths from Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer â€“ WHO & ILO  
Source: WHO & ILO news item, 08 November 2023  

Key Facts:
- Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.  
- Working outdoors under intense UV exposure significantly increases risk of NMSC.  
- Approximately one-third of deaths from non-melanoma skin cancer globally are linked to occupational exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Risk Factors:
- Prolonged sunlight exposure (especially UV-B and UV-C).  
- Work environment without adequate sun protection (e.g., shade, protective clothing, sunscreen).  
- Geographic location and latitude (more UV in equatorial / high sun exposure regions).

Prevention:
- Use protective clothing, wide-brim hats, gloves, sunglasses.  
- Use broad-spectrum sunscreen.  
- Provide shade, schedule outdoor work outside peak sun hours.  
- Regulatory policies and labor protections for outdoor workers to reduce UV exposure.

Implications:
- Occupational safety needs stronger enforcement.  
- Awareness campaigns for outdoor workers.  
- Health systems should include NMSC risk in skin disease prevention programs.
