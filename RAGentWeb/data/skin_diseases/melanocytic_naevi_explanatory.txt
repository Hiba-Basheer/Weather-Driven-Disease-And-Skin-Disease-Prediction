Title: Melanocytic Naevi â€“ Definition, Risk, Clinical Features

Definition:
- Melanocytic naevi (also called moles) are benign proliferations of melanocytes (pigment-producing skin cells).
- Common in all skin types; usually appear during childhood and adolescence.

Epidemiology & Risk Factors:
- Number of naevi increases with UV exposure, sunburn history, lighter skin tone, familial history.
- Individuals with many moles or atypical (dysplastic) naevi are at higher risk for melanoma.
- Skin of colour may show fewer visible naevi, but pigmentation and contrast differences can affect detection.

Clinical Features & Differentiation:
- Typically uniform in color (brown to tan or dark brown), regular borders, round or oval, stable over time.
- ABCDE criteria used to screen for suspicious lesions: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6 mm, Evolution of lesion.
- Dermoscopic features: regular pigment network, uniform globules, no atypical vascular patterns, no regression structures.

Management & Monitoring:
- Most naevi require no treatment; monitor for changes in size, colour, border, evolution.
- If changes occur, biopsy or dermatological assessment is needed.
- Protect skin from excessive UV exposure (sunscreen, shade, protective clothing).

Prevention & Best Practices:
- Educate about self-examination (looking for changing moles).  
- Regular skin checks, especially for high-risk individuals.  
- Avoid deliberate tanning, minimize sunburns.
