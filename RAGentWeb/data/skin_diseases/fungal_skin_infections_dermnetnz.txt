What are Fungal Skin Infections?
- These are skin conditions caused by various fungi (dermatophytes, yeasts, molds).  
- Commonly affect the superficial layers of skin, hair, and nails.  

Types and Examples:
- Dermatophyte infections (tinea): tinea corporis, tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), tinea cruris (groin), tinea capitis (scalp), etc.  
- Yeast infections: Candida species causing intertrigo, etc.  
- Pityriasis (Malassezia / yeast-related fungus) causing pityriasis versicolor.

Risk Factors:
- Warm, humid climates favor growth of fungi.  
- Occlusion / tight clothing, sweating, poor ventilation.  
- Contact with infected objects, animals, soil.  
- Reduced immunity, skin barrier damage (secondary infections), hygiene factors.  

Clinical Features:
- Often itchy, scaly rash.  
- Borders may be well defined; sometimes central clearing (especially in tinea corporis).  
- Color, appearance vary by skin type.  
- Yeast infections may cause moist, red patches in skin folds; sometimes maceration.

Diagnosis:
- Usually clinical diagnosis based on appearance.  
- Skin scrapings / KOH for microscopic identification of fungal elements.  
- Culture in cases of treatment failure or extensive involvement.  

Treatment & Management:
- Topical antifungal creams (azoles, allylamines) are first choice.  
- For extensive or resistant cases → systemic antifungals.  
- Keeping skin clean and dry; avoid moisture; change socks/clothing; good foot hygiene.  
- For yeast infections, treat underlying moisture, treat folds carefully.  

Prevention & Self-Care:
- Dry skin thoroughly after bathing; avoid sharing towels/socks.  
- Use breathable clothing/shoes.  
- Proper foot hygiene.  
- Environmental hygiene: clean and dry damp areas; avoid prolonged dampness.
