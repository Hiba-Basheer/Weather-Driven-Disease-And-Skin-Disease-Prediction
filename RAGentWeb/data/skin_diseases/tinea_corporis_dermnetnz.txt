What is Tinea Corporis?
- Tinea corporis is a superficial fungal infection of the skin, also known as ringworm when on the body.  
- Caused by dermatophyte fungi (e.g. Trichophyton, Microsporum species).

Epidemiology & Risk Factors:
- More common in warm, humid climates.  
- More frequent in people with heavy sweating, occlusion (tight clothing), poor hygiene, contact with infected persons or animals.  
- Risk increases with immunosuppression or disrupted skin barrier.

Clinical Features:
- Round or oval patches with well-defined, slightly raised, scaly, red border and central clearing.  
- Itching is often present.  
- May spread centrifugally.

Diagnosis:
- Usually clinical diagnosis based on appearance.  
- Skin scrapings / KOH preparations to identify fungal elements; culture in more difficult cases.

Treatment & Management:
- Topical antifungal creams (azoles, allylamines).  
- For widespread or severe infection: systemic antifungal therapy.  
- Keep affected skin clean and dry; avoid tight clothing; antifungal powders useful in moist areas.  

Prevention & Best Practices:
- Avoid sharing personal items (towels, bedding).  
- Wash clothing / bedding in hot water; dry properly.  
- Treat infected pets.  
- Maintain hygiene, reduce moisture (use breathable fabrics).
