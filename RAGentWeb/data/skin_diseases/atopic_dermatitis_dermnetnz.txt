What is Atopic Dermatitis?
- Atopic dermatitis (also called eczema) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease.
- It is characterized by itchy, dry skin with periodic flares.
- It usually begins in childhood but can persist into or develop during adulthood.

Epidemiology:
- Common condition: many children are affected; varies by region; often a family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema).
- Associated with high serum IgE and sensitization to environmental allergens.

Causes & Risk Factors:
- Genetic predisposition (family history of atopic diseases — asthma, hay fever, eczema).
- Environmental triggers: irritants (soap, detergents), allergens (dust mites, pet dander, pollens), climatic conditions (dry, cold air).
- Barrier dysfunction: skin barrier impairment leads to increased water loss and potential allergen/harmful microbe penetration.
- Immune dysregulation.

Clinical Features:
- Dryness, erythema (redness), itching, scaling.
- In infants: often affects cheeks, scalp, extensor surfaces.
- In older children/adults: flexural areas (elbow creases, behind knees), neck, eyelids.
- Acute flares → red, swollen, maybe oozing/leaking fluid.  
- Chronic → thickened skin (lichenification), scratch marks, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation after healing.

Diagnosis:
- Usually clinical diagnosis based on history and presentation.
- May include allergen testing (patch test or serum IgE) if severe or persistent.

Treatment & Management:
- Regular use of emollients / moisturizers to restore skin barrier.
- Topical therapies: corticosteroids (mild to potent depending on severity), topical calcineurin inhibitors, other non-steroid anti-inflammatory treatments.
- For moderate-to-severe or widespread disease: systemic therapies (immunosuppressants, biologics) may be considered.
- Avoiding known triggers: soaps, fragrances, harsh detergents, allergens, extreme weather.

Quality of Life & Impact:
- Causes itch, discomfort, sleep disturbance.
- Children may suffer impact on daily life: school, play; adults: work and social life.
- Psychological impact: stress, anxiety, social stigma.

Prevention & Self-Care:
- Gentle cleansing; avoid over-bathing; use fragrance-free products.
- Keeping skin well moisturized.
- Avoid scratching; use cold compresses during flares.
- Identify and minimize exposure to individual triggers (allergens, irritants, dry air, etc.).
