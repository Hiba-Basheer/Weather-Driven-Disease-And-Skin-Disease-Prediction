What is Dermatitis?
- Dermatitis refers to a group of itchy inflammatory skin conditions characterised by epidermal changes.
- It may be classified by cause (e.g. allergic contact, irritant, photosensitive), by appearance (discoid, hyperkeratotic, pompholyx), or by site (hand, eyelid, lower leg).
- The terms “dermatitis” and “eczema” are often used interchangeably. All eczema is dermatitis, but not all dermatitis is eczema.

Who gets Dermatitis?
- Very common: about 1 in 5 persons will have dermatitis at some stage of life.
- Atopic dermatitis and pityriasis alba are more common in children.
- Hand eczema is more frequent in young and middle-aged adults.
- Venous or gravitational eczema, asteatotic dermatitis, and nummular eczema appear more often in middle and older age groups.

Clinical Features:
- In acute cases: redness/swelling, papulation, vesiculation, oozing/weeping, blistering.
- Subacute: features of both acute and chronic.
- Chronic: thickening of skin; accentuation of skin creases; hyperkeratosis; scaling; fissuring; excoriation; hyper-/hypopigmentation.

Types of Dermatitis:
- Exogenous (external causes) examples:  
  * Allergic contact dermatitis (e.g., nickel, hair dye, perfume)  
  * Irritant contact dermatitis (soaps, detergents, chemicals)  
  * Photosensitive dermatitis (light/UV)  
  * Drug-induced, trauma-related, infections contributing
- Endogenous causes include:  
  * Atopic dermatitis (associated with family history of asthma/hay fever)  
  * Seborrhoeic dermatitis (face, scalp, ears, flexures)  
  * Nummular/discoid eczema  
  * Pityriasis alba  
  * Others: hand dermatitis, eyelid dermatitis, asteatotic dermatitis, metabolic, juvenile plantar dermatitis, etc.

Differential Diagnosis:
- Fungal infections, bacterial infections, rosacea, blistering diseases, skin tumors, lupus erythematosus, etc.

Investigation:
- History and examination often enough  
- Skin swabs/scrapings (if secondary infection suspected)  
- Patch testing for allergens  
- Blood tests (e.g. IgE), sometimes skin biopsy

Treatment:
- Identify & avoid irritants and allergens  
- Use emollients regularly (after washing, when skin feels dry)  
- Topical therapies: anti-inflammatory creams/steroids; mild potent steroids used short term, tapering / reducing frequency  
- Non-steroid options: calcineurin inhibitors, newer small molecules (JAK-inhibitors) for certain cases
- Physical therapy: UV therapies (e.g. UVB, PUVA) in resistant cases  
- Systemic therapy for severe chronic cases: immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azathioprine, ciclosporin); biologics (dupilumab etc.)
