What is Melanoma?
- Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes, cells that produce pigment (melanin).
- Less common than other skin cancers, but more dangerous because of higher tendency to spread (metastasize).

Epidemiology:
- Melanoma incidence is rising globally in light-skinned populations.  
- Risk increases with age, but can occur in young adults.  
- Important risk factors: intense intermittent UV exposure (sunburns), family history, many moles / atypical nevi, fair skin, freckling, low ability to tan.

Clinical Features:
- Typical signs: asymmetry, border irregularity, colour variation, diameter (>6mm), evolution (change over time) — the ABCDE criteria.
- Variation in presentation: can be flat or raised; may ulcerate; may present in atypical locations (palms, soles, mucosal surfaces).
- Dermatoscopic features: irregular pigment network, variegated colours, dots/globules, regression, blue-white veil.

Diagnosis:
- Biopsy is required for histopathological confirmation.  
- Types include superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, acral-lentiginous melanoma.  
- Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate are key prognostic factors.

Staging & Prognosis:
- Early detection (thin lesions) has very good prognosis; survival drops with depth, ulceration, and metastasis.  
- Treatment options depend on stage.

Treatment:
- Surgical excision with adequate margins is the main treatment for localized melanoma.  
- For advanced/metastatic melanoma: targeted therapies (if mutations like BRAF), immunotherapy (IL-2, checkpoint inhibitors), sometimes radiation or chemotherapy.

Prevention:
- Sun protection: sunscreen, protective clothing, avoiding sunburn.  
- Self-skin checks, monitoring moles for change.  
- Public awareness campaigns.

Important Notes / Special Types:
- Acral and mucosal melanomas are more common in non-white skin and have worse prognosis.  
- Melanoma risk also influenced by genetics and UV exposure history.
